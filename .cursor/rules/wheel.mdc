How the Wheel Works:

Start: Begin with cash or existing shares
Sell OTM Cash-Secured Puts (CSP): Sell puts below the current stock price to collect premium
If CSP expires worthless: Keep the premium and repeat step 2
If CSP is assigned: You acquire shares at the strike price
Sell OTM Covered Calls (CC): Once you have shares, sell calls above the current price
If CC expires worthless: Keep the premium and repeat step 5
If CC is assigned: Your shares are sold at the strike price, and you return to step 2
This creates a continuous cycle of generating income while potentially accumulating or managing stock positions.

Covered Call Strategy - Weekly/Bi-Weekly Approach
The Bullish Income Strategy

Covered calls are ideal for investors who are bullish long-term but want to generate consistent income while holding shares. The weekly or bi-weekly approach maximizes premium collection through accelerated time decay.

📅 Weekly Approach
Expiration: 5-7 days out
Strike: 3-5% OTM
Premium: Lower per trade, but compounds faster
Annualized Return: 8-15% from premiums alone
Best for: High volatility periods, active management
Example: Stock at 450, sell 465 call (3.3% OTM) for $3.50

Weekly yield: 0.78% (3.50 / 450)
Annualized: ~40% (if repeated 52x, though not all weeks are equal)
📅 Bi-Weekly Approach (Recommended)
Expiration: 10-14 days out
Strike: 5-10% OTM
Premium: Better premium per trade
Annualized Return: 5-10% from premiums
Best for: Moderate volatility, less active management
Example: Stock at 450, sell 485 call (7.8% OTM) for $6.00

Bi-weekly yield: 1.33% (6.00 / 450)
Annualized: ~35% (26 cycles, though varies)
🎯 Target: 5-10% Annual Return from Premiums

Conservative approach: Sell calls 5-10% OTM with 2-4 week expirations. This balances:

Premium income - Enough to hit 5-10% annually
Upside participation - Room for stock appreciation before assignment
Risk management - Less likely to be called away on minor moves
💰 If Called Away - Start the Wheel!
When your covered call is assigned and shares are sold:

Collect the strike price - You've sold at a profit (strike > your cost basis ideally)
Keep the premium - This is yours regardless
Use cash to sell puts - Start the wheel by selling cash-secured puts
Target entry point - Sell puts at a strike where you'd happily buy back in
Repeat the cycle - Get assigned? Sell covered calls. Expire worthless? Sell more puts.
The Key Insight: Being "called away" isn't losing - it's taking profits and resetting for the next opportunity. The wheel keeps your capital working whether you hold shares or cash.

📊 Covered Call Return Calculator

Quick Math for Target Returns:

Target Annual Return	Required per Trade (Bi-weekly)	Required per Trade (Weekly)
5%	0.19% per trade	0.10% per trade
8%	0.31% per trade	0.15% per trade
10%	0.38% per trade	0.19% per trade
15%	0.58% per trade	0.29% per trade
Formula: Premium / Stock Price = Trade Yield

Example: 5 premium on 500 stock = 1% trade yield

If bi-weekly: 26 trades × 1% = 26% annualized (before assignment events)
Reality: Factor in ~50% capture rate due to rolls/assignments = ~13% actual
