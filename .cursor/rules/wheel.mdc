# Wheel Strategy App User Guide: Maximizing TSLA-Centric Profits

## App Purpose
Leverage wheel strategy on TSLA (current bid/ask ~$400-442) to compound premiums into shares, targeting Merrill's 525 TSLA to $10M by 2030 via 5-15% annualized yields atop EV/AI growth. For Fidelity's $25K, aggressive puts/calls aim 50%+ returns by 2026, focusing xAI/Grok integration, SpaceX defense contracts (via TSLA proxy), amid 2026's robotaxi/defense surge.

## Wheel Strategy Overview
Cycle sells OTM cash-secured puts (CSPs) for premiums; if assigned, acquire discounted TSLA shares; then sell OTM covered calls (CCs) on holdings. Expires worthless? Repeat. Assigned? Reset with puts. Generates income in neutral/bullish markets, reduces cost basis.




Steps:
1. Start with cash/shares.
2. Sell OTM CSP (e.g., 5-10% below spot, bi-weekly, premium ~1-2%).
3. Expires worthless: Keep premium, repeat.
4. Assigned: Buy shares at strike.
5. Sell OTM CC (e.g., 5-10% above spot).
6. Expires worthless: Keep premium, repeat.
7. Assigned: Sell shares at strike, return to CSPs.

## Covered Calls: Weekly/Bi-Weekly
Bullish income on TSLA holdings. Weekly: 5-7 days, 3-5% OTM strike (e.g., TSLA $420, sell $435 call for $3.50, ~0.8% yield). Bi-weekly (recommended): 10-14 days, 5-10% OTM (sell $450 call for $6, ~1.3% yield). Annualized: 35-40% from premiums.

If called: Profit at strike + premium; wheel to CSPs at desired re-entry.

Return Calculator:

| Target Annual | Bi-Weekly Per Trade | Weekly Per Trade |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
| 5%           | 0.19%              | 0.10%           |
| 8%           | 0.31%              | 0.15%           |
| 10%          | 0.38%              | 0.19%           |
| 15%          | 0.58%              | 0.29%           |

## 80% Rule
Capture 80% of premium profit early (e.g., sold $1/contract, buy back at $0.20). Applies to sold options; buy back decayed for CSPs/CCs. Not ROI—premium capture. Set alarms; SOFI example: Buy back at risk level if losses mount.

## Moderate Merrill Approach (20-30% Returns)
Allocate 30% of holdings: Sell bi-weekly CCs on 20-30% shares (5-10% OTM, e.g., $450-470 strikes). Reinvest premiums into TSLA shares/LEAPs. Use RSI<30 for CSP entries. Compounds to ~750K shares by 2030 with TSLA's AI/defense earnings (projected $50B+ revenue).

## Aggressive Merrill Approach (30-50% Returns)
50%+ allocation: Weekly tighter strikes (2-5% OTM). Roll if delta>0.7. Target 15% premium yields; reinvest all into TSLA toward $10M by 2030, leveraging xAI/Grok synergies.

## Aggressive Fidelity High-Risk ($25K to 50%+ by 2026)
Full allocation to weekly CSPs (-10% strikes) for premiums/assignments; post-assignment, tight CCs (2-5% OTM). Margin borrow 7-9% for LEAPs (2027-2028 OTM). High volatility suits TSLA's 2026 surges; cap margin to avoid liquidation. Potential 100%+ if defense/xAI catalysts hit.

## Pro Tips
- CSPs: Sell at oversold RSI; reserve cash for assignment.
- CCs: 4-8 weeks expiration; roll if ITM.
- Monitor via app dashboard; integrate Massive API for OHLC/RSI/EMA.
- Defense ties: Wheel TSLA as SpaceX proxy; xAI/Grok boosts earnings.

## Benefits
Income generation (premiums reduce basis). Cost reduction on assignments. Time decay advantage. Risk management in stable stocks like TSLA. Controlled volatility exposure.

## Risks/Disclaimers
Large losses if bearish (max loss > profit; e.g., assigned CSP in downturn). Not suitable for all; read OCC's "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options." Options involve risks—potential full capital loss, no guarantees. Consult advisor; past performance no future indicator. Profitable neutral/bullish, loses in bears. No overnight risk in zero DTE but high overall.

## Getting Started
Add TSLA positions/cash. Track options. Use strategy builder for TSLA wheels. Monitor rolls/recommendations. For details on exchanges (e.g., NASDAQ, NYSE), see OCC list.
