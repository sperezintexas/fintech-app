# Grok-Integrated Risk Management Guidelines for Cursor

You are implementing Grok-powered risk management in the myInvestments app: Use Grok API for advanced reasoning on portfolio/account risk (e.g., assess VaR, beta, diversification, stress tests). Integrate as a hybrid: fast local metrics first, then Grok for nuanced recommendations. Tie into existing scanners (e.g., OptionScanner) and scheduler jobs. Add to chat for on-demand queries.

## Core Goals
- Compute basic risk metrics locally (e.g., portfolio beta, volatility, Sharpe ratio).
- Use Grok for complex reasoning: "Is this portfolio too risky for a conservative profile?" → recommendations like adjust allocations, hedge with puts.
- Support per-account risk levels (conservative/moderate/aggressive) from MongoDB.
- Generate risk alerts/recommendations via scheduler (new job: `riskScanner`).
- Expose in chat: Users query "Analyze my portfolio risk" → Grok processes with tools.

## Required Behavior
- **Metrics Calculation** (local first):
  - Portfolio: Total value-at-risk (VaR at 95%), beta vs benchmark (SPY), Sharpe/Sortino ratios, diversification score (e.g., Herfindahl index).
  - Positions: Contribution to risk (marginal VaR), Greeks for options (delta, gamma, vega).
  - Use Yahoo Finance for historical data/volatility.

- **Grok Reasoning**:
  - Prompt Grok with: Account risk profile, current metrics, positions summary, market conditions.
  - Grok outputs: { riskLevel: 'low'|'medium'|'high', recommendations: string[], confidence: number, explanation: string }.
  - Use tools: web_search for economic outlook, Yahoo tools for data.

- **Integration Points**:
  - Scheduler: New `riskScanner` job → run daily → store in `alerts` → deliver via channels.
  - Chat: Extend `/api/chat/grok/route.ts` to handle risk queries → pull portfolio context.
  - Reports: Add risk summary to `/app/reports`.

## Implementation Priorities
1. **Local Risk Utils**
   - Create `src/lib/risk-management.ts` with:
     ```ts
     async function computeRiskMetrics(portfolio: Portfolio): Promise<RiskMetrics>
     interface RiskMetrics { vaR: number, beta: number, sharpe: number, diversification: number, ... }
